# Amazon Clone

This is a static front-end Amazon UI clone, developed independently using HTML5 and CSS3, focusing on replicating the look, feel, and structure of the original Amazon homepage. It’s designed to emulate a real e-commerce platform layout with responsive product boxes, headers, and footers.

The project includes a fully functional header navigation, a search bar with icon integration, a hero section, category boxes for products, and a comprehensive footer with multi-level links. All elements are customized to be visually accurate to the real Amazon interface, built entirely from scratch.

This project is a great demonstration of what can be achieved with just markup and styling — no JavaScript or backend technologies involved.
