# Amazon Clone

This is an Amazon homepage clone built using HTML and CSS. It features a responsive navigation bar, search layout, dynamic product category sections, and a structured footer. The design closely mirrors Amazon’s actual interface, helping learners understand layout techniques, flexbox, and component-based styling. 

The project demonstrates core front-end concepts like semantic HTML, reusable CSS classes, and hover effects. It’s lightweight, beginner-friendly, and ideal for those starting with web development. A great foundation for future enhancements like JavaScript-based interactivity and mobile responsiveness.
